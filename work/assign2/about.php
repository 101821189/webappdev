    <ul>
        <li>TODO: say what tasks i did not complete</li>
        <li>for this assignment i have done the following extra tasks:
        <ul>
            <li>used bootstrap</li>
            <li>created custom styling with CSS</li>
            <li>created a user class and helper functions for easier user data management</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>
            the part that i had the most trouble with was getting the user class and it's
            helper functions to a point where they were all working as intended. this
            ended up being time well spent however since it was far easier to work with any
            user data as a result.
        </li>
        <li>
            currently the code base is a bit fragmented and out of order. there's certainly a
            lot more repeated code than i would have liked, so more time spent earlier on
            refactoring and sticking to cleaner code standards would be something very much
            worth considering in the future.
        </li>
        <li>there are no additional features added to the site</li>
        <li>links to some pages:
        <ul>
            <li><a href="friendslist.php">friends list</a> (note that if you are not logged in you will be sent to the login page)</li>
            <li><a href="friendadd.php">add friends</a> (note that if you are not logged in you will be sent to the login page)</li>
            <li><a href="index.php">home</a></li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>i did not participate on the discussion board for this assignment</li>
